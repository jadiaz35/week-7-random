random_number = randint(1,11)

# Random Practice #2
# Implement the random() function from the random library to obtain a real number between 0 and 1, and store that value in a variable called random_number.
random_number = randint(0,2)

 # Random Practice #3
# Use the random library's choice() method to get a random item from the list of names below, and store the chosen name in a variable called raffle.
